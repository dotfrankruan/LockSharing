This project is an OpenPGP Keyserver. 

It's designed to be more efficient and more flexible than the original SKS Keyserver. 

We designed it to be _backwards compatible_ with GnuPG with additional feature available using our client or accessing it directly. But we tried our best to meet the [OpenPGP Keyserver specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-gallagher-openpgp-hkp).

The specification itself is still a draft, so we cannot assure it will always work. **Use with caution**.
